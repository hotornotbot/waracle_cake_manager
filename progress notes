//day 1
2-3 hours after work on thursday:
Read spec, decided to migrate project to spring boot for readability/ maintainability.
Used spring intitializr with web, thymeleaf, JPA and h2 dependencies.

Got the basic functionality working with a simple thymeleaf web front end.

separated the thymeleaf controller from the rest controller.

Tested application with spring boot integration test


//day2 sunday morning /early afternoon

Implemented image upload/view for thymeleaf and image upload for REST controller
altered integration test to test image upload.

Added dockerfile and made port configurable

//EXTENSIONS

I had limited time to complete this exercise but there are any possible extensions to make it production ready:

1: BDD tests
2: Validation and error handling
3: CSS/styling/ look and feel improvements to web front end
4: Oauth authentication for adding cakes
5: Persistent DB
6: Upload files to service like amazon S3
7: Container orchestration
